# Data Analyst Portfolio Project: SQL to Interactive Dashboard

**A step-by-step walkthrough of designing a SQL database and transforming data into an interactive BI dashboard.**

---

##  Project Overview
This project demonstrates a full data analytics workflow using:
1. **SQL Database Design & Queries** – setup and exploration of relational data.
2. **Data Extraction & Transformation** – refining data for visualization.
3. **Interactive Dashboard Creation** – visual storytelling through BI tools.

##  Technologies Used
- MySQL
- Power BI 
- Python


---
##  Setup & Steps

### 1. Database Setup
- Run `setup_database.sql` to create the relational schema and import the dataset.
- Populate tables with relevant data—structure tables to support downstream analysis.

### 2. SQL Querying & Analysis
- Use `analysis_queries.sql` for cleaning and transformations.
- Example queries:
  - Filtering records
  - Aggregating metrics (SUM, AVG, COUNT)
  - Joining related tables
  - Calculated fields for business logic

### 3. Data Preparation for BI
- Export refined tables or queries as CSV.
- Ensure clean, well-formatted data: column names, types, date formatting, etc.

### 4. Dashboard Creation
- Import cleaned data into your BI tool.
- Design visuals:
  - KPIs and summary metrics
  - Trend charts (time series)
  - Categorical breakdowns (e.g., by product, region)
- Enable interactivity: filters, drill-downs, click-throughs.

##  Key Learnings
- Structuring a SQL database for analysis-ready querying
- Writing complex queries to derive business insights
- Bridging SQL and BI tools effectively for visualization
- Designing dashboards that tell a cohesive data story

This is our client's brief.
Its a rough outine of our main objectives: This however is not sufficient,its up to us to address the spececifities 
of the business objectives

The three main areas of focus, orders, stock control and staff are  3 tables.
Their relationships need to be established by us

For the orders table some priliminary fields are provided:

The business scenario provides us with a menu we can look at the it perhaps to clue us in on how to format our tables:

From this we derive the following:

We expand on the what was provided-

Next we exam the user's requirements stock control and staf requirements

From this we can derive the necessary relationships between our tables

The software:Quick DBD was used for the entity relationship diagram below

##  Future Enhancements
- Automate data refresh and dashboard update (e.g., via scheduled SQL and BI pipelines).
- Integrate additional data sources (like Excel or APIs).
- Add forecasting or advanced analytics features (time series, clustering).
- Implement storytelling narratives within dashboards (dashboard storytelling).
