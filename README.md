# Data Analyst Portfolio Project: SQL to Interactive Dashboard

**A step-by-step walkthrough of designing a SQL database and transforming data into an interactive BI dashboard.**

---

##  Project Overview
This project demonstrates a full data analytics workflow using:
1. **SQL Database Design & Queries** – setup and exploration of relational data.
2. **Data Extraction & Transformation** – refining data for visualization.
3. **Interactive Dashboard Creation** – visual storytelling through BI tools.

This walkthrough is based on the video guide "Data Analyst Portfolio Project – SQL | Step-by-Step Guide from SQL Database to Interactive Dashboard.":contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

##  Data Sources
- **[Dataset Name or Source]** – brief description (e.g. "Customer transactions, orders, product info").  
- (Optional) **Download Link** or instructions for obtaining the data.

---

##  Technologies Used
- **SQL** (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server)  
- **SQL Client/IDE** (e.g., pgAdmin, SQL Server Management Studio)  
- **BI Tool** (e.g., Power BI, Tableau, Looker)  
- (Optional) **Additional Tools** – e.g., Python or Excel for preprocessing

##  Setup & Steps

### 1. Database Setup
- Run `setup_database.sql` to create the relational schema and import the dataset.
- Populate tables with relevant data—structure tables to support downstream analysis.

### 2. SQL Querying & Analysis
- Use `analysis_queries.sql` for cleaning and transformations.
- Example queries:
  - Filtering records
  - Aggregating metrics (SUM, AVG, COUNT)
  - Joining related tables
  - Calculated fields for business logic

### 3. Data Preparation for BI
- Export refined tables or queries as CSV.
- Ensure clean, well-formatted data: column names, types, date formatting, etc.

### 4. Dashboard Creation
- Import cleaned data into your BI tool.
- Design visuals:
  - KPIs and summary metrics
  - Trend charts (time series)
  - Categorical breakdowns (e.g., by product, region)
- Enable interactivity: filters, drill-downs, click-throughs.

##  Dashboard Overview

Your interactive dashboard should include key sections such as:
- **Overview Page** – High-level metrics (e.g., total sales, average order value) and overall trends.
- **Category/Segment Page** – Breakdown by customer segments, product categories, regions.
- **Time Analysis Page** – Trends over time, seasonality, and anomalies.

##  Key Learnings
- Structuring a SQL database for analysis-ready querying
- Writing complex queries to derive business insights
- Bridging SQL and BI tools effectively for visualization
- Designing dashboards that tell a cohesive data story

---

##  Future Enhancements
- Automate data refresh and dashboard update (e.g., via scheduled SQL and BI pipelines).
- Integrate additional data sources (like Excel or APIs).
- Add forecasting or advanced analytics features (time series, clustering).
- Implement storytelling narratives within dashboards (dashboard storytelling).
